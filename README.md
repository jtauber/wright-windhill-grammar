# A grammar of the dialect of Windhill, in the West Riding of Yorkshire by Joseph Wright

Took default OCR from https://archive.org/details/grammarofdialect00wrigrich/page/3/mode/1up (`/raw/ocr.txt`) and am correcting it (`/raw/corrected.txt`) before marking it up.

See https://github.com/jtauber/gothica for similar work on Wright's 1910 Grammar of Gothic.
